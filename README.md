## Project Description
This project recreates a historical Urdu newspaper page from Al-Fazl dated January 16, 1940, translating and rephrasing all content into English while maintaining the original layout structure. The HTML implementation uses semantic HTML5 elements and inline styling to accurately represent the three-column newspaper layout, including the masthead, main headlines, article sections, and footer. The recreation preserves the visual hierarchy and column structure of the original publication, featuring news articles about international diplomacy, community updates, and industrial development statements.

## Features Implemented
- **Proper HTML5 Document Structure:** Complete `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration with semantic HTML5 elements
- **Semantic HTML5 Tags:** Used `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` for proper document structure
- **Multi-Column Table Layout:** Implemented a complex table structure with three main columns and a two-column lower section to match the original newspaper grid
- **Heading Hierarchy:** Proper use of `<h1>` through `<h4>` tags maintaining logical document structure
- **Unordered List:** Included `<ul>` and `<li>` elements in the Prime Minister/Indonesia article section
- **HTML Comments:** Added descriptive comments explaining each major section of the code
- **Consistent Indentation:** Maintained proper 2-space indentation throughout the document
- **Inline Styling:** Used inline styles for colors, alignment, borders, and typography to match the original design
- **Accessibility:** All semantic elements properly structured with meaningful IDs and descriptive content
- **Masthead Recreation:** Recreated the newspaper header with subscription information, publication name, and issue details
- **Boxed Sections:** Implemented bordered sections for special content like "Ahmadiyya News"
- **Horizontal Separators:** Used `<hr>` tags to create visual divisions matching the original layout

## Challenges Faced
The main challenge was accurately recreating the complex three-column newspaper layout using HTML tables while maintaining semantic HTML5 structure. Balancing the need for precise column widths and borders with clean, readable code required careful planning of the table structure. Additionally, translating and rephrasing the Urdu content into natural English while preserving the journalistic tone of the original articles required multiple iterations to ensure accuracy and readability. The solution involved using nested tables and colspan attributes to create the lower section that spans multiple columns, matching the original layout's visual hierarchy.
